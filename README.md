# Why
Just a technical research demo at [101test](http://101test.com), We were thinking about build native app both on Android and iOS, but we don't want to develop on two paltform.

This project is developed happily with [Fusetools](https://www.fusetools.com)

# How to use
* Android: Download from [Fir.im](http://fir.im/wifly) or build by yourself
* iOS: build by yourself

Have fun!
